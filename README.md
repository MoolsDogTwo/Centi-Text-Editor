# NOTE: This program is archived and a new version will be written from the ground up using Terminal.GUI as a UI backend, and a new backend structure that will hopefully not be as rigid as this one lol.

### Current limitations
 - Resizing the terminal breaks the whole UI
 - Only one file can be opened in a single session
 - Searches aren't highlighted
 - No syntax highlighting
 - Cannot be configured (i.e. keybindings, themes, visual stuff)
 - Lacks undo/redo features
 - UI very minimalY
